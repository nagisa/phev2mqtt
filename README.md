# phev2mqtt - Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV to MQTT gateway

Utility to interact with a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV via the Wifi remote
control protocol.

Inspired by https://github.com/phev-remote/ but written entirely in Go.

For further hacking, read the [protocol documentation](protocol/README.md).

Tested against a MY18 vehicle.

## Getting started.

### Compiling

#### Install Go

 * Download and install the latest [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl/)
   * Your distro packager may have a version thats too old
   * For raspbian choose the ARMv6 release

#### Install PCAP dev libraries

 * Ensure you have install the libpcap-dev package

#### Download, extract, and compile phev2mqtt

 * Download the phev2mqtt archive
 * Extract it
 * Go into its the top level directory and run *go build*
 * Verify it runs with *./phev2mqtt -h*

### Connecting to the vehicle.

#### Configure Wifi client on system running mqtt2phev

On your computer running the phev2mqtt tools, configure a new Wifi connection to the
car's SSID,

#### Register the client to the car

Follow the [Mitsubishi instructions](https://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/en/products/outlander_phev/app/remote/)
to find the Wifi credentials provided with the car.

Verify that your Wifi connection to the car is established - your local IP address
should be 192.168.8.47.

Follow the [Mitsubishi instructions](https://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/en/products/outlander_phev/app/remote/)
and put the car into registration mode ("Setup Your Vehicle"). You may need to
re-establish the Wifi connection.

Register by running `phev2mqtt client register` and you should shortly see a message
indicating successful registration.

#### Testing the tool

Once connected to the car, you can sniff for messages by running *phev2mqtt client watch*.
The phone client needs to be disconnected for this to work.
You'll see a bunch of data go by - some of those will be decoded into readable
messages such as charge and AC status.

### MQTT Gateway

The primary feature of this code is to run as a proxy between the car and
MQTT. Registers with car status are sent to MQTT, both as raw register
values and decoded functional values. Commands sent on MQTT topics can
be used to control certain aspects of the vehicle.

Start the MQTT gateway with:

`./phev2mqtt client mqtt --mqtt_server tcp://<your_mqtt_address:1883/ [--mqtt_username <mqtt_username>] [--mqtt_password <mqtt_password>]`

The following topics are published:

| Topic/prefix | Description |
|---|---|
| phev/register/[register] | Raw values of each register, as hex strings |
| phev/available | Wifi connection status to car. *online* or *offline* |
| phev/battery/level | Current drive battery level as a percent |
| phev/climate/status | Whether the car AC is on |
| phev/climate/mode | Mode of the AC, if on. *cool*, *heat*, *windscreen* |
| phev/climate/[mode] | Alternative of above. Modes are *cool*, *heat*, *windscreen* which can be *off* or *on* |
| phev/charge/charging | Whether the battery is charging. *on* or *off* |
| phev/charge/plug | If the charging plug is *unplugged* or *connected*. |
| phev/charge/remaining | Minutes left, if charging. |
| phev/door/locked | Whether the car is locked. *on* or *off* |
| ~~phev/door/front_left~~ | State of doors. *closed* or *open* |
| ~~phev/door/front_right~~ | State of doors. *closed* or *open* |
| phev/door/front_passenger | State of doors. *closed* or *open* |
| phev/door/driver | State of doors. *closed* or *open* |
| phev/door/rear_left | State of doors. *closed* or *open* |
| phev/door/rear_right | State of doors. *closed* or *open* |
| phev/door/bonnet | State of doors. *closed* or *open* |
| phev/door/boot | State of doors. *closed* or *open* |
| phev/lights/parking | Parking lights. *on* or *off* |
| phev/lights/head | Head lights. *on* or *off* |
| phev/lights/hazard | Hazard lights. *on* or *off* |
| phev/lights/interior | Interior lights. *on* or *off* |
| phev/vin | Discovered VIN of the car |
| phev/registrations | Number of wifi clients registered to the car |

The following topics are subscribed to and can be used to change state on the car:

| Topic/prefix | Description |
|---|---|
| phev/set/register/[register] | Set register 0x[register] to value 0x[payload] |
| phev/set/parkinglights | Set parking lights *on* or *off* |
| phev/set/headlights | Set head lights *on* or *off* |
| phev/set/cancelchargetimer | Cancel charge timer (any payload) |
| phev/set/climate/[mode] | Set ac/climate state (cool/heat/windscreen/off) for [payload] (10[on]/20/30) |
| phev/set/climate/state | `[payload]=reset` clears "terminated" state |
| phev/connection | Change car connection state to (on/off/restart) |

#### Home Assistant discovery

The client supports [Home Assistant MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) by default.

After initial discovery, re-run the binary for the entities to appear. You can
search for "phev" in your entity list. Your car should also appear as a device
in the Devices tab.

You can disable this with `--ha_discovery=false` or change the discovery prefix, the default is `--ha_discovery_prefix=homeassistant`.

#### Raspbian setup with auto-start

It's useful to have the tool auto-start when running on e.g a Raspberry Pi. The following
describes how to set this up.

- Edit or add to `/etc/systemd/network/00-default.link` with the following:

```
[Match]
# This should be the 'real' (default) mac address of the Pi's wireless interface.
MACAddress=b8:27:eb:50:c0:52

[Link]
# This should be the MAC address to use to connect to the car, per above.
MACAddress=ee:4d:ec:de:7a:91
NamePolicy=kernel database onboard slot path

```

- Add the car's Wifi info to `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`:

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=AU

network={
	ssid="REMOTE45bhds"
	scan_ssid=1
	psk="blahblahbla12314"
}

```

- Add the following to `/etc/systemd/system/phev2mqtt.service`, updating the MQTT address to
suit your setup:

```
[Unit]
Description=phev2mqtt service script
StartLimitIntervalSec=5
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=exec
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/phev2mqtt --config=/dev/null client mqtt --mqtt_server tcp://192.168.0.88:1883 -v=debug

# Restart script if stopped
Restart=always
# Wait 30s before restart
RestartSec=30s

# Tag things in the log
# View with: sudo journalctl -f -u phev2mqtt -o cat
SyslogIdentifier=phev2mqtt

StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Copy the `phev2mqtt` binary to /usr/local/bin and make sure it's executable.

- Start the service with `sudo systemctl start phev2mqtt.service`

- Enable the service to run at boot, with `sudo systemctl enable phev2mqtt.service`.

- Restart the Pi and verify that it can connect to the car. Also run `ifconfig` and check
that the `wlan0` interface has the correct mac address. You should also see this interface
have the IP address `192.168.8.47`.

- Verify that the phev2mqtt service is communicating with the car, by checking
the logs: `sudo journalctl -f -u phev2mqtt -o cat`

### Sniffing the official client

Further development of this library can be done with a packet dump of the official
Mistubishi app.

A number of sniffer apps for phones are available for this. Two that the author have
used are *Packet Capture* and *PCAP Remote*. These do not require root access, yet
can successfully sniff the traffic into PCAP files for further analysis.

*Packet Capture* can save the PCAP files to your local phone storage which you can
then extract off the phone.

*PCAP Remote* is a little more involved, but allows for live sniffing of the traffic.

Once you have downloaded the PCAP file(s) from the phone, you can analyse them with
the command *phev2mqtt decode pcap <filename>*. Adjust the verbosity level (-v)
between 'info', 'debug' and 'trace' for more details.

Additionally, the flag '--latency' will use the PCAP packet timestamps to decode
the packets with original timings which can help pinpoint app events.
